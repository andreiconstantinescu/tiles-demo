## Tiles Demo App

### Description

A friend asked my help with a React Native app and I thought the best way to explain the core principals along with how things work in RN is with an example app. I am aware that it lacks of many good practises like using Redux/Sagas, but the purpose of this not using them was better.

This [Expo](https://expo.io) app simply creates 2 grids of tiles that react to the onPress event and change styles. One of the grid is static - loading the content from memory, the other makes a couple of calls to [swapi](https://swapi.co) to gather the data. Nothing fancy.

### Deployment

Fell free to test it out [here](https://expo.io/@andrei0610/tiles-demo).
